# AI-art-human-art-classification
This project uses tensorflow and keras to successfully classify AI and human made images. The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kausthubkannan/ai-and-human-art-classification).
The repo also includes a couple of other files related to preprocessing the dataset as well as testing of the model. After running several tests, my model was able to classify images with a success rate of
about 85%. For this project I used Tensorflow's Keras framework to build my convolutional neural network.
